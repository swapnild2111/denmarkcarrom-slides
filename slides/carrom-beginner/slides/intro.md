# 🕹️ Understanding the Game

--

## What is Carrom?

Carrom is a **tabletop board game** that originated in India and is now played worldwide.
It involves flicking small discs ("carrom men") into corner pockets using a **striker disc**.

--

## Carrom Board Layout

- 4 pockets at each corner.
- 9 white + 9 black coins + 1 red **Queen**.
- Each player sits on one side of the board.

🧭 Goal: Pocket your coins before your opponent — and cover the Queen.

--

## Basic Setup

- 2 or 4 players.
- Use **powdered surface** for smooth play.
- Winner of toss chooses to **break** or **select coin color** (white or black).

---

# ⚖️ Basic Rules of Carrom

--

## 1️⃣ Turns and Striking

- You must flick the striker **with one finger** only.
- The striker should start **within the baseline**.
- You can pocket your own color coins (white or black).

--

## 2️⃣ Queen Rule

- You must pocket the **Queen** and then **"cover"** it by pocketing your own coin in the next shot.
- Failing to cover means the Queen returns to the board.

--

## 3️⃣ Fouls and Penalties

- Pocketing striker → 1 coin penalty.
- Pocketing striker + own coin → 2 coin penalty.
- Pocketing opponent's coin → chance skip & turn continue.
- No physical touch to any coin during game → 1 coin penalty.
